### Simulation
__MM1:__ Simple design of single-server queue simulation with Bernoulli trials using Lindley's Equation

__Switch:__ Simulation of Bernoulli Switches using Hungarian algorithm for scheduling. The simulation handles switches with small sizes. (n < 128)

  - **3x3**: Sample code of a simple packet switch with size 3.
  - **nxn**: Main Simulation of testing the behaviors of quantities observed with n x n switches.
